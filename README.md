1. Created an empty list.

2. I appended elements.

3. Inserted a number at the second position (index 1) since index 0 is the frst position.

4. Extended the list with more numbers.

5. Removed my last element in my list using pop which is 70.

6. Sorted the list in ascending order(from the small figure to the largest).

7. Found and printed the index of 30.

8. I then printed the final list.

9. I ran the program at the terminal by bashing python3 my_list.py.
